## What you will learn?

In this course I will teach you different skills, techniques and strategies senior software engineers use daily in their life to solve complex business problems. This course is very hands on, but we will touch on key theories: when the time is right. You will learn about spiral learning method and how it encourages reinforcement of previously-learned concepts, which promotes the retention of skills. You will learn and apply Alan Kay’s theory: 4 levels of knowledge (playing, ). You will learn that making mistakes actually makes you smarter because you are eliminating a chance of failure in future. You will learn that your brain is really a network and not a database. Then you will learn from the book “The Power of Languages” that your brain is really a super computer with parallel processing capability. You will learn why traditional learning methods: school, most online courses, books doesn’t really teach you software engineering and is the main reason you are stuck in your javascript journey. You will learn about some of my early struggles with learning javascript.
